# Students-Pass-Fail-Model-based-on-Artificial-Neural-Network
  It is a simple Binary classification model to predict a student's result(pass/fail) on the basis of few parameters. Key points about the Project: (a) Data set with 650 entries was taken with 32 Attributes (b) Implemented the Deep Learning models using Keras library (c) GUI was made using tkinter library
